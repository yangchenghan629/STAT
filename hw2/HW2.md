HW 2.1: 
- download hourly Ts data from NTUCOOL (HW2_data.zip, original data are from 大氣資料庫)
	- 台北測站 (HW2_Taipei.txt)
	- 台東測站 (HW2_Taitung.txt)
 	- Both are for 1960s (1961\~1970) and 2000s (2001\~2010)
  - Please look at HW2_readme_for_txt.jpg to find out the data structure.
  
- Please finish below tasks for the two stations in the two periods and focus on July!
  - **2.1.1** Calculate mean Ts for 1960s (1961\~1970) and 2000s (2001\~2010). **(4 numbers in total)**
  - **2.1.2** Calculate the mean maximum Ts and minimum Ts for two stations in two periods (based on the max. and min. of each day) **(8 numbers in total)**
  - **2.1.3** Calculate the mean DTR (diurnal temperature range) and the variance (based on the hourly data) for each station in two periods **(8 numbers in total)**
    - Please discuss whether Is there a relationship between larger DTR and larger variances?
  - **2.1.4** Plot the average diurnal cycle for 1960s and 2000s **(4 lines in total)**, compare the difference for each station and discuss what you see from the figure.
